it enables CRUD operations for managing employees' information as (personal info, salary, department).

## Technologies
The following technologies and libraries are used in developing the system:

1. **Java:** the primary programming language used for this project.
2. **Spring Boot:** The core framework providing auto-configuration, dependency management, and streamlined integration with other Spring-based technologies.
3. **Lombok:** A library that reduces boilerplate code by generating common methods such as getters, setters, constructors, builders, and equals/hashCode methods through annotations.

4. **PostgreSQL:** An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage application data.

5. **Spring Data JPA & Hibernate:**\
\- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** A specification for object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java, enabling seamless mapping between Java objects and database tables.\
\- **Hibernate:** an implementation provider for the JPA specifications and has a wide compatibility with various databases.\
\- **Spring JPA:** Simplifies the development of database access layers by abstracting boilerplate code and providing a repository-based approach to database operations.
6. **Flyway:** A database migration tool that provides version control, repeatable schema migrations, and consistency across multiple environments.
7. **Hibernate Validator:** A library for defining and enforcing validation constraints on data models. It supports annotations to validate input data and ensure consistency.
8. **Spring Security:** is a framework with powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control.
9. **JJWT:** A library used to create and validate JWTs, ensuring secure and stateless authentication.
10. **Junit:** A popular framework for writing and running unit tests in Java.
11. **Mockito** A testing framework for mocking dependencies in unit tests, allowing isolation of components.
